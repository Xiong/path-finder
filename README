Path-Finder version 0.0.0

"Where the @!$*#! are my files!??"
                -- with apologies to Harvey Pekar

You want to store installation-specific files somewhere. Support files, 
configurations, databases, properties, preferences, options: these are not 
primary user data. You want to store them in some path during development, 
install them to some other path on a target host, find them at run time. 

You want a cross-platform solution and you don't want demanding dependencies. 
You want to survive difficult installations and handle upgrades cleanly. 
You don't want to be bothered by too many details but you want some control. 

You may want several configurations on the same machine: default, system, 
user, project. Path::Finder will let you store and retrieve such files easily.
